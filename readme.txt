Overall Objectives of the Application:

Web App and Phone App
Develop Web App first?

Interactive Strikezone with pitcher/batter matchup filters driven by date and game.
As the user drags a ball around a strikezone, pitches within some arbitraily small 
distance of the center of the ball are displayed as points. Strikes are red. Balls
are blue. When you click on a pitch, you get a drop down of attributes about that 
pitch. You could see velocity, spin rate, outcome, etc.

Below is something I wrote when I was very blazed. I wrote this about 6 weeks ago -- 
before we discussed this project. I had forgotten I wrote it:

Design Plans

A web application for baaseball data analysis is clearly the thing that I have been
meaning to write this whole time. I hadn't seen it yet. But now... Now I do. 

A user pops in. She sees a strikezone -- with a draggable baseball. First though,
she must enter the names of the pitcher or batter she wants to analyze. But we wouldn't want 
to restrict her on that.

Indeed, we could have her look at some type of statistic, and where that happened in the zone.

Point being, dynamic fun scaling tools to analyze interpretivley.
